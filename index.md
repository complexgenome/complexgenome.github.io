Thank you for dropping by my webpage.

I'm Sanjeev Sariya, a statistical geneticist with over a decade of work experience in industry and academia. I enjoy doing genetics research at personalized as well as population wide level. I enjoy drawing insights from genetics data employing bioinformatics, statistical and visualization tools.  
I'm currently employed at Mount Sinai, New York, USA; my research is focused on Multiple Myeloma where I'm involved in developing precision medicine pipeline and reports.

**Education**:  
I did my Bachelor's in Bioinformatics from Maulana Azad National Institute of Technology, Bhopal, India. Eventually, I acquired my MS in Bioinformatics from Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, USA. 

**Research Experience**:  
I've had opportunity to work and learn in different research domains: bacterial, phylogenetics, population level, cancer.    

I gained experience in microboiomics and bacterial genomics at George Washington University (GWU), Washington DC. I developed pipeline for genome assemnbly, MLST. In Microbiomics I was responsible for developing an in-house pipeline for Illumina 300bp V3-V4 region. I curated database for species level classifier.  
I acquired skills in human genetics at Columbia University Medical Center, New York, USA. I conducted research in Alzheimer's Disease (AD) in Caribbean Hispanics (CH), perfomed population/genome-wide analysis (GWAS). 



**Interests**:   
In my free time I enjoy playing with my dog, cooking, working out (weights and swimming), doing yoga. If time permits I read books of varied genres.
