Work and Research Experience:  
I've had opportunity to work and learn in different research domains: bacterial, phylogenetics, population level, cancer.    

I gained experience in microboiomics and bacterial genomics at George Washington University (GWU), Washington DC. I developed pipeline for genome assemnbly, MLST. In Microbiomics I was responsible for developing an in-house pipeline for Illumina 300bp V3-V4 region. I curated database for species level classifier.
I acquired skills in human genetics at Columbia University Medical Center, New York, USA. I conducted research in Alzheimer's Disease (AD) in Caribbean Hispanics (CH), perfomed population/genome-wide analysis (GWAS). 

I enjoy doing genetics research at personalized as well as population wide level. I enjoy drawing insights from genetics data employing bioinformatics, statistical and visualization tools.
In my free time I enjoy playing with my dog, cooking, working out (weights and swimming).
